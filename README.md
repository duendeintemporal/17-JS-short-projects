# 17 JavaScript Projects

Sometime I change the CSS and the JS to try it by my self, but in many cases I donÂ´t make any change to the code, there are 17th projects from @codewithbubb, I think this is one of the best channels of youtube to learn to code. Thanks to Bubb...(some examples need to add the extension Allow CORS(cross-origin resource sharing) to the browser o work properly)
