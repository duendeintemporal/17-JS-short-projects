# 17 JavaScript Projects

Sometimes I change the CSS and JS to try it myself, but in many cases, I donâ€™t make any changes to the code. There are 17 projects from @codewithbubb, and I think this is one of the best YouTube channels to learn to code. Thanks to Bubb! (Some examples need to have the Allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) extension added to the browser to work properly.)
